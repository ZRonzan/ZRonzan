## Who am I?

Being born in the Philippines with a greek name and raised in Australia, it doesn't make much sense, but it's me. From a civil engineering and construction background, taking the plunge into new territory: building apps, the one thing that remains the same is my love for solving puzzles and being part of a team. Making products with the goal of helping others is where I want to be, and software has made so many things better for all of us. I want to be a part of that.
